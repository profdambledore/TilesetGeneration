# TilesetGeneration
 A tileset generation system in Unreal Engine 4/5

 In this project, I have created a tileset-based generation system to allow worlds to be generated via separate 'islands' with doorways connecting each one in order.  Using a tree data structure to store the world elements, users can generate, clear and regenerate worlds at a call of a function, while a seed system allows users to create the same worlds multiple times via an integer.
